# Software-Construction-Lab
Course projects for the UCLA course entitled "Software Construction"

[project_1](https://github.com/jpicchi18/Software-Construction-Lab/tree/main/project_1): Learned basic linux commands, how to use Emacs, and how to use Lisp (with Emacs)

[project_2](https://github.com/jpicchi18/Software-Construction-Lab/tree/main/project_2): Learned how to set up private-public key pairs, and how to use OpenSSH and ssh-agent to manage authentication for login convenience. Also learned how to use X-Quartz for X-forwarding with a remote server, and how to set up transparent multi-hop SSH.

[project_3](https://github.com/jpicchi18/Software-Construction-Lab/tree/main/project_3): Utilized shell scripting to automate tasks. Used regex to run an English dictionary spellchecker on a webpage. Based on this EnglishChecker, I created a HawaiianChecker script designed to check the spelling of words in a file based on a Hawaiian dictionary. Created a shell script to automate filename validity audits in a file hierarchy, based on provided restrictions on which characters appear in a file name.

[project_4](https://github.com/jpicchi18/Software-Construction-Lab/tree/main/project_4): Learned how to use patching and diff files. Created a Python implementation of the Linux ```shuf``` command, with some additional features.

[project_5](https://github.com/jpicchi18/Software-Construction-Lab/tree/main/project_5): Learned how to use ```malloc``` and ```calloc``` for memory allocation. Implemented a program to sort frobnicated data based on its unfrobnicated form, all without ever unfrobnicating the data itself.

[project_6](https://github.com/jpicchi18/Software-Construction-Lab/tree/main/project_6): Implemented the Linux ```tr``` command in C, using both buffered and unbuffered data. Expanded on project_5 by using system calls to take data from stdin or from a file. Compared the performance of buffered vs. unbuffered system calls.

[project_7](https://github.com/jpicchi18/Software-Construction-Lab/tree/main/project_7): Static/Dynamic Linking and Dynamic Loading. Took a given program and modified source files to use dynamic loading and dynamic linking instead of static linking.

[project_8](https://github.com/jpicchi18/Software-Construction-Lab/tree/main/project_8): Git. Learned how to use Git for version control, including how to visualize the Git commit tree on the command line and in a GUI. Explored storage formats and structure of the ```.git``` folder in a Git repository.

[project_9](https://github.com/jpicchi18/Software-Construction-Lab/tree/main/project_9): Git and Python. Implemented a Python program that generates a topological ordering of the Git commits that are stored in the ```.git``` directory.

project_10](https://github.com/jpicchi18/Software-Construction-Lab/tree/main/project_10): Report and Presentation. Picked a recent computer science innovation and wrote a report/class presentation on the topic. The topic of my report and presentation was digital twins, specifically as they are used to model urban environments.
