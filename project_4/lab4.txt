lab log 
========

1. /usr/bin/ls -a -A     --> acts like the output of "ls -a"
   /usr/bin/ls -A -a     --> acts like the output of "ls -a"

   These two commands verify that the problem (ie that -a always overrides -A)
   still occurs in "/usr/bin/ls". In other words, regardless of which of the two
   commands above is called, the output always contains "." and "..".


2. /usr/bin/ls --version       --> outputs "ls (GNU coreutils) 8.22", thus
   	       		       	   indicating that the Coreutils version that
				   "/usr/bin/ls" corresponds to is 8.22


3. wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
				--> Downloads the Coreutils 8.29 source code
				    compressed tarball

   wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
				--> Downloads the tarball's signature

   wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
				--> Downloads the GNU keyring


4. gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
				--> verifies the tarball's signature using the
				    GNU keyring

   Note:
	The output of this command states
	    "Good signature from 'P@draig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>'"
	thus affirming that the tarball has not been altered since its
	encryption with the developer's private key.

   Note also:
   	The output also contains the lines
	    "WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!"
	    "There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner."
	This occurs because I have not yet verified the GNU keyring. Thus,
	unless I use my private key to sign the afforementioned public key,
	this warning message will be displayed because I have not explicitly
	verified that I trust that the public key actually does belong to the
	listed person.


5. To compile and install Coreutils into a temporary directory:

   tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz     --> unzips (ie decompresses) the tarball.
       	     			       	   "-x" means that we are extracting the
					   files.
					   "-J" means that we are filtering the
					   archive through xz.
					   "-v" specifies that we want verbose
					   output.
					   "-f" means that we are specifying a
					   file to be decompressed.

   cd coreutils-8.29/ 	--> to navigate to the newly created directory
      			    containing the decompressed files from the tarball

   cd ..
   mkdir tempdir	--> creates a temporary directory in which I can install
   	 		    Coreutils
   cd tempdir

   pwd			--> specifies the absolute file path, which I use in the
   			    following command

   cd ../coreutils-8.29/
   ./configure --prefix=/u/be/ugrad/picchi/Desktop/35L/ass4/lab/tempdir
			--> installs the Coreutils files in the "tempdir"
			    directory.
			    The "prefix" flag allowed us to specify "tempdir"
			    as the directory in which the files should be
			    installed.

   make			--> compiles the files

   make install 	--> installs the executable binary in "tempdir"

   I did not run into any note-worthy problems.


6. reproducing the bug:

   tempdir/bin/./ls -a ~		--> output includes "." and ".."
   tempdir/bin/./ls -A ~		--> output does NOT include "." or ".."
   tempdir/bin/./ls -aA ~		--> output includes "." and ".."
   tempdir/bin/./ls -Aa ~		--> output includes "." and ".."

   The last two commands above indicate that the bug has been reproduced because
   "-a" overrides "-A" and displays the "." and ".." directories, no matter
   what order the two options are listed.

7. Applying the patch of Bug#30963 Message 10:

   Download the patch file at https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?msg=10;
   bug=30963;att=1;filename=0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch
					--> NOTE: "wget" did not work when I
					    tried it with this link, so I
					    manually downloaded it on my local
					    machine and used "scp" to copy it
					    to the lnxsrv

   mv 0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch coreutils-8.29
					--> move the patch file into the
					    "coreutils-8.29" directory

   cd coreutils-8.29/
   patch -p1 <0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch
					--> applies the patch to the files in
					    "coreutils-8.29/src"

   NOTE: the ouput of the last command produced the lines
   	    	 "patching file NEWS"
	 	 "Hunk #1 FAILED at 4."
	 though it still appears as though "src/ls.c" was properly patched, as
	 indicated by the lines
	 	   "patching file src/ls.c"
	 	   "Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines)."


8. building the fixed version of ls:

   autoreconf -fi     --> updates the generated configuration files.
   	      	      	  "-i" specifies that we should copy any missing
			  auxiliary files
			  "-f" specifies that we want to consider all files
			  obsolete, and thus remake all of them
   	      	      	  
   make		      --> compiles the binary executables in the src directory,
   		      	  but not in the "tempdir" directory that was originally
			  specified in "./configure --prefix=...", as the
			  intallation of the binaries in "tempdir" would require
			  use to run the command "make install".

9. Making sure the changes fix the bug:

   coreutils-8.29/src/ls -a ~		--> output includes "." and ".."
   coreutils-8.29/src/ls -A ~		--> output does NOT include "." or ".."
   coreutils-8.29/src/ls -Aa ~		--> output includes "." and ".."
   coreutils-8.29/src/ls -aA ~		--> output does NOT include "." or ".."

   The last 2 commands listed prove that the changes did, in fact, fix the bug
   because the command "-aA" now works properly in that the "-A" command
   overrides the "-a" command because "-A" is listed after "-a".
