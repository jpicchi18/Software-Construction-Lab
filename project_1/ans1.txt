1.
man -k keyword

In this case, "keyword" is the specific word we are searching for in the commands' man pages. I discoverd this by running the command "man man", which provided a man page with a description of the function of the command "man -k keyword" (the keyword was actually "printf" in the man the man page).


2.
mv is located in the directory /usr/local/cs/bin/
sh is located in the directory /usr/bin/

shell commands I used:
which mv   --> to find the location of the mv program
which sh   --> to find the location of the sh program


3.
/usr/bin/tr  --> translates or deletes characters
/usr/bin/ar  --> creates, modifies, and extracts from archives
/usr/bin/pr  --> converts text files for printing

shell commands I used:
man find    --> to learn how to search for executables
find /usr/bin -name ?r -executable   --> to search for programs with the given specifications, since "?" signifies any possible character
man tr      --> to find what tr does
man ar      --> to find what ar does
man pr      --> to find what pr does


4.
The file that is actually executed is "/usr/bin/emacs-24.3"

shell commands I used:
ls -l /usr/bin/emacs   		--> found that /usr/bin/emacs is a symbolic link to /etc/alternatives/emacs
ls -l /etc/alternatives/emacs   --> found that /etc/alternatives/emacs is a symbolic link to /usr/bin/emacs-24.3
ls -l /usr/bin/emacs-24.3   	--> found that /usr/bin/emacs-24.3 is the file being executed


5.
The version number of "/usr/bin/gcc" is 4.8.5
The version number of the plain gcc program is 9.3.0

The two programs differ because the plain gcc program is located in "/usr/local/cs/bin/", since this is the first directory in the PATH that the shell searches when you type the command "gcc". "/usr/bin/gcc" is is a gcc program located in a different directory that is searched in lower precedence compared to "/usr/local/cs/bin/".

6.
The given symbolic mode means that we are changing the permissions on the file in 3 ways:
(1) allowing all users to execute the file with owner permissions
(2) giving the owner permission to execute the file
(3) removing permission for others (those who are not the owner and not in the group) to write to the file


7.
Total number of entries: 446
First 5 entries:
/usr/local/cs
/usr/local/cs/src/git
/usr/local/cs/src/git/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/coreutils
/usr/local/cs/src/coreutils/RCS

shell commands I used:
find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28   --> [-type d] specifies that we are searching for directories, and [-mtime -28] indicates that we are searching for those modified in the last 28 days = 4 weeks.


8.
# symbolic links in the same directory as find = 280

shell commands:
whereis find   			--> to discover that "find" is located in the directory "/usr/bin/"
find /usr/bin -type l > count   --> to find all of the symbolic links in the directory "/usr/bin" and
					place the output of the function in a file called "count"
man wc  			--> to discover how to use "wc"
wc -l count   			--> to display the number of lines in the "count" file (ie the
					number of symbolic links in the same directory as find)


9.
oldest file: librom1394.so.0.3.0
last modified: Dec 28, 2013
Age: 6 years + 3 months + 8 days

shell commands used:
man ls   	     --> to discover that "-a" includes entries starting with ".", "-l" displays a long list with modification dates, and "-t" sorts by time with the newest file first
ls /usr/lib64 -alt   --> to generate a list of files, including those with ".", that lists the oldest file last


10. 
The "locale" command gets its data from the settings of certain environment variables.

shell comands used:
man locale   --> the answer was found in the "description" section


11.
downcase-dwim
downcase-region
downcase-word

emacs commands used:
C-h a
d o w n c a s e return


12. 
C-M-r   --> runs the command isearch-backward-regexp, which performs an
	    incremental search backward for regular expession
C-M-s   --> runs the command isearch-forward-regexp, which performs an
	    incremental search forward for regular expression
C-M-t   --> runs the command transpose-sexps, which transposes sexps
C-M-u   --> runs the command backward-up-list, which moves backward out of one
	    level of parentheses
C-M-v   --> runs the command scroll-other-window, which scrows the next
	    window up ARG lines (full screen if no ARG)

emacs commands:
C-h k   --> provides a description of the keyboard command inputed directly
    	    after it
C-M-r through C-M-v   --> each was inputed separately after "C-h k" so as to
      	      	      	  display descriptions of their functions


13.
"C-g" runs the command keyboard-quit, signals a 'quit' condition. During
execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly. At top level,
as an editor command, this simply bleeps. Quitting with 'C-g' is the way to
get rid of a partially typed command, or a numeric argument that you don't
want. Furthermore, if you are in the middle of a command that is running,
'C-g' stops the command in a relatively safe way.

emacs commands:
C-h k C-g   --> provides concise information about the command 'C-g'
C-h K C-g   --> provided more extensive documentation about the command


14.
the yank function reinserts ("pastes") the last stretch of killed text. In
other words, in reinserts the most recent kill, which is the stretch of
killed text that was most recently killed or yanked. If you perform a yank,
then perform another directly after, it will cycle through the kills from
most recent to least.

You can easily invoke yank using C-y.

emacs commands:
C-h f   --> provided a description of the functionality and keystrokes
    	    associated with yank


15.
The difference in output is that the "ls -l" command displays less entries
than the directory listing of the dired command. The "ls -l" command only
shows 236664 entries compared to the dired command's 236748. Dired's listing
number is equivalent to that displayed by "ls -la", thus indicating that dired
automatically displays files beginning in ".", whereas "ls -l" ignores such
entries unless the "-a" argument is appended.

shell commands:
ls -l /usr/bin   --> displayed the directory contents using the "ls -l"
      		     command

emacs commands
C-h i		    --> to navigate to the info directory
m Emacs Enter 	    --> to navigate to the Emacs manual from the info
  		    	directory
C-s dired Enter    --> to retrieve the description of the dired command
C-s d /usr/bin Enter --> to run the dired command on the "/usr/bin" directory
